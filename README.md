## ImageCompressor

A simple image compressor made in Java.

## Note

This project is based on a University project originally built in Haskell.

My main goal with this project isn't to make a useful/functioning desktop application, but to try out and learn how to make some. So see this as an experiment rather than a project.

This experiment is also an opportunity for me to try out the release feature from Github.
